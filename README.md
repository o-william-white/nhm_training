# NHM bioinformatics training

Training material for linux accessing HPC resources at the NHM. 

The webpage is currently hosted [here](https://o-william-white.github.io/nhm_training/) with the long term aim of moving this to the NHM git repo. 

The webpage is written in [just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) with all tutorial data in markdown format. 

## Contributing

Here are instructions on how to contribute training material. 


```
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/o-william-white/nhm_training.git

# change directory
cd nhm_training

# create branch, replacing 'test_branch' with a relevant name for you
git checkout test_branch
```

Once you have your own copy of the repo and new branch, you can make changes to the file structure. 

When finished, submit a pull request and the changes will be reviewed before uploading. 

## Adding new tutorials

If you would like to create your own tutorial, just create a new markdown file in the docs folder. If the tutorial requires multiple sections, you can create a subdirectory in the docs folder with multiple markdown files within it.

## Images

All images can be placed in the images directory.
