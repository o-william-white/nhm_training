There are three main options for accessing HPC resources at the NHM. Each resource has its own advantages so select the option which is best for your research.

### Franklin and Sanger

{: .highlight }
[Franklin and Sanger](http://pgfsites.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/H21/franklin.html) are are compute servers for research at the NHM, part of the molecular biology computing facility. 

They are used mainly for phylogenetics, sequence database searching, and molecular sequence analysis. It is set up to be flexible and interactive. **An important consideration is that these servers do not use a job schedular (i.e. SLURM)**. 

It is managed by Peter Foster (p.foster2@gmail.com) who is available for advice on how to use it. 

It is running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, (Focal Fossa), with 56 cores, with 2 threads per core, making 112 cpus and 256G of RAM.

### NHM HPC

The NHM HPC is compute server maintained by Technology Solutions (TS).

The NHM HPC is used for all types of computational analyses across the museum. **Note that the NHM HPC uses a job schedular (see using SLURM).**

Rob Foster (robert.foster2@nhm.ac.uk) is the best contact for issue relating to the NHM HPC.

### Crop Diversity

[Crop Diversity](https://help.cropdiversity.ac.uk/) is run and maintained by the James Hutton Institute’s Information & Computational Sciences (ICS) Research Computing team, and the Scientific Computing section of NIAB’s IT team, this resource supports the computational needs of researchers from six UK institutions including: 
- The James Hutton Institute (JHI)
- The National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB)
- The Natural History Museum (NHM)
- Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE)
- Royal Botanic Garden, Kew (RBGK)
- Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC)

Crop Diversity is used for all types of computational analysis and has a wide range of computational resources for different needs. **Note that the NHM HPC uses a job schedular (see using SLURM).**

Crop Diversity is used by a large community of researchers and the slack channel (cropdiversity-hpc.slack.com) is usually the best place to contact for issues related to Crop Diversity. 

Crop Diversity is by far the largest computational resource available. Full details can be found [here](https://help.cropdiversity.ac.uk/system-overview.html).
